# GenshinBuildApp

This web app is for theorycrafting builds for characters in Genshin Impact. You can create an account and save characters, weapons,
and artifacts to your account. You will be able to combine your characters, weapons, and artifacts to make a build
and look at the stats for the build with a stat sheet similar to what you would see in game.<br>
